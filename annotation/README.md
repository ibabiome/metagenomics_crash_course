# Metagenome annotation
Metagenome annotation is the process of labeling sequences as genes or genomic elements and also determining what those genes do. In this session, we will use [MetaErg](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00999) to annotate our metagenome contigs. MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenomic and metaproteomic data annotation pipeline. It bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. MetaErg is available to download at [github](https://github.com/xiaoli-dong/metaerg) and the portable [MetaErg Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaolidong/docker-metaerg) is also available to download.
