# EBG metagenomics crash course
This crash course is offered by [Marc Strous](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg/people/marc-strous) to train our new graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the [Energy Bioengineering and Geomicrobiology](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg) group. This is a genome-centric metagenomics data analysis course, which teaches students and researchers how to obtain provisional whole genomes of individual populations from a mixed microbial community using metagenomics. The tutorials of this course were prepared by [Xiaoli Dong](https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/ebg/people/xiaoli-dong).
