# MetaErg
MetaErg is a stand-alone and fully automated metagenomic and metaproteomic data annotation pipeline. It bundles essential annotation tasks such as feature prediction, functional annotation with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches as well as blast and diamond searches. It estimates and visualizes quantitative taxonomic and pathway compositions of multiple metagenomic and proteomics samples using sequencing coverage and proteomics spectral counts, respectively. For visualization, MetaErg provides a HTML interface, bringing all annotation results together in sortable and searchable tables, collapsible trees, and other graphic representations, enabling intuitive navigation of complex data.

# Required perl modules
If you do not use Docker, you will need to install perl modules. MetaErg requires Perl 5.6.0 or higher and runs on Linux platforms. Besides the perl core modules, it also requires the following perl modules to be installed:
```
* Archive::Extract;
* Bio::Perl;
* Bio::DB::EUtilities
* DBD::SQLite
* DBI;
* File::Copy::Recursive
* LWP::Protocol::https
* SWISS::Entry;
* SWISS::KW;
```
