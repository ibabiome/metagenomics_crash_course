# Rapidly reconstruct the SSU rRNAs
[phyloFlash](https://github.com/HRGV/phyloFlash) is a complete workflow for SSU rRNA-targeted profiling of metagenomes that integrates database preparation, read extraction, taxonomic classification, targeted assembly and SSU rRNA targeted binning. It has been designed to provide a quick and user-friendly overview of the composition of metagenomic sequence libraries based on all domains of life, and can be used for the rapid screening and comparison of multiple samples, and for retrieving complete SSU rRNA genes and the associated genomic bins. This section, we are going to run phyloFlash program over our quality controlled sequences.
