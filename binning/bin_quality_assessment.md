# Metagenome bin quality assessment
CheckM provides a set of tools for assessing the quality of genomes (bins) recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. It provides robust estimates of genome completeness and contamination by using collated sets of genes that are ubiquitous and single-copy within a phylogenetic lineage. checkm.txt contains the CheckM results summary of genome completeness/contamination for your bins.

## Create checkm directory
```
#assume you are in the "binning" directory
#make "checkm" directory inside the "binning" directory  
>mkdir checkm
#move into the "checkm" directory
>cd checkm
```
